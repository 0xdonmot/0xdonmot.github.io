## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

There are a couple of extra libraries needed to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python:
- joypy
- cmasher


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I looked into WHO data to try to understand:

How other developers suggested breaking into the field (what education to pursue)?
- What are the key socioeconomic factors which influence life expectancy?
- How do these factors change across developed and developing countries?
- Have these factors changed over time?


## File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>
There is 1 notebook available here which tries to reach answers for the above questions. It also contains some steps to clean data where relevant. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@0xdonmot/can-you-guess-what-global-life-expectancy-trends-look-like-b2091b15ff2a).


## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
Must give credit to the WHO and Kaggle for the data, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who).
